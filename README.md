Introduction to deep learning in computer vision
==============================

About
------------
This repo contains the work for the different projects for the course introduction to deep learning in computer vision.

Environment Setup
------------
Activate your virtual environment
```
source <your_env>/bin/activate
```
If you do not already have one then run

```
python -m venv <your_env>
```

Then install the local package
```
pip install -e . 
```

Finally, install any dependency to be able to run the project
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to run experiments using wandb then go to the wandb team folder
dtu_dlcv and find your api key and copy it. Then run the following command.
```
wandb login --relogin 
```
and paste your key when prompted.

That is it.
